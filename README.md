## üß© Embedding the Chat Widget

To embed the chat widget on your website, follow these steps:

### 1. Add the Script to Your HTML Head

Place this script tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML file (e.g., `index.html`):

```html
<script
  src="https://chat-support-7j2g.onrender.com/chat-widget.js"
  async
></script>
```

> Replace the `src` URL with your deployed server address if self-hosting.

### 2. Add the Widget Element

Insert the following custom element where you want the chat widget to appear, replacing `your-widget-id` with your actual widget ID:

```html
<chat-support-widget widgetid="your-widget-id"></chat-support-widget>
```

You can find your `widgetid` in your workspace settings.

### 3. Verify Installation

After adding both code snippets, check your website to ensure the chat widget appears.  
If you encounter any issues, please contact our support team.
